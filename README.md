# Develop your very own QR Code:  
This QR code was made from scratch using python library segno. It is very fun to generate your own vs getting it from online. 
## Running: 
Before running the script, we will need to ensure we have the desire module and If we don't we will do the following:  
<ul>
  <li> $ pip install segno</li>
  <li>$ pip install qrcode</li>
  <li>$ Third item</li>
</ul> 
For conda based do:   
<ul>
  <li>$ conda install -c conda-forge segno</li>
</ul>
